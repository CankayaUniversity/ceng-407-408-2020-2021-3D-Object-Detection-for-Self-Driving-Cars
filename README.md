3D Object Detection for Self-Driving Cars

Object detection is crucial research are for Autonomous Vehicles to detect surrounding objects of the ego vehicles. The Autonomous Vehicles has exteroceptive sensors such as Camera, LIDAR, Radar and SONAR to measure or detects a property of the environment, or changes to a property over time. The project dataset was a total of 117 GB. The dataset gives a 3D point cloud and camera data from the AV test veh icles. The data was captured by 10 host cars on the roads of Palo Alto, California. Each of the host cars has seven cameras and one LIDAR sensor on the roof, and 2 smaller sensors underneath the headlights of the vehicle. This research project aims to build and optimize algorithms based on a large-scale dataset. The projectâ€™s dataset features the raw sensor camera inputs as perceived by a fleet of multiple, high-end, autonomous vehicles in a restricted geographic area.
